# üöÄ My Coding Journey
Hi! This is my repository where I save solutions to problems, pet projects, and code experiments. Here you can track my programming progress and find useful examples.


## Explanation of the First Code for AI

This code performs how works fully connected AI with step activation function (Perceptron)
